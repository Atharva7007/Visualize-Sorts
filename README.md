# Visualize-Sorts

A tool to visualize different sorting algorithms using Python and PyGame.

The contents of an array are visualized as bars on the GUI. The array is randomly shuffled and it is sorted using the selected algorithm.
Currently, two sorting algorithms have been implemented:
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
